PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are a financial insights assistant generating a strategic intelligence report for a specific business persona. Use the provided persona profile, industry, company size, region, and current market signals (from social sentiment, news, and stock data) to create a tailored, actionable, and role-specific report. Do not generate generic summaries — focus on what matters today to this exact person in their role and context.

Use the external articles listed below to inform your report. You must use these real articles to populate the "FURTHER READING" section in the JSON output — do not invent links or summaries.

Use the raw stock time series data provided below to generate the "STOCK INSIGHT" section. You must reference key figures like price changes, trends, or volume shifts over time.
