        "selftext": "Just a quick warning for anyone who‚Äôs been invited into WhatsApp or Telegram groups promoting OST (Ostin Technology Group). These groups are aggressively hyping the stock with daily messages claiming ‚Äúbig news is coming‚Äù and encouraging people to buy more or hold no matter what.\n\nThey also suggest selling other stocks to ‚Äúfree up capital‚Äù and time entries to push buying pressure. A lot of the messages seem copy-pasted across groups, and some users even pretend to be retail traders sharing fake screenshots of profits. It looks very coordinated.\n\nThe company itself has no real fundamentals. Their SEC registration has been withdrawn, so they‚Äôre not required to publish financial filings anymore. There are no listed put options, and shorting the stock is extremely difficult and expensive due to high borrow fees and low availability. That alone should raise questions.\n\nAll of this looks like a textbook pump-and-dump. Small float, low liquidity, hyped via private groups, no transparency, and hard for outsiders to short or hedge. Once the price spikes and new retail money is in, the original organizers will likely sell and leave the rest holding worthless shares.\n\nIf you‚Äôre in any of these groups, be very careful. Don‚Äôt trust anonymous admins, and definitely don‚Äôt put money into something just because a group is telling you to. If it smells like a scam, it probably is.\n"
