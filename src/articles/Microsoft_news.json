They’re usually typical engineering demonstrations, but last month I was invited to Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington, to see how the company built its two new smaller Surface Pro and Surface Laptop devices. And this time around, I was pleasantly surprised to be shown how Microsoft uses magnets, robots, drop tests, and smoke to perfect its laptop and tablet designs.\n\nThe first stop on the tour led me inside Microsoft’s advanced prototype center, where Surface engineers are constantly creating prototypes to refine the fit and finish on a new product like the Surface Pro 12-inch. One of the new challenges for this device was getting the Surface Pen to attach to the rear of the tablet — and stay there.\n\nMicrosoft stress tests its Surface Slim Pen on a Surface Pro 12-inch. Image: Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nMicrosoft wanted the stylus to attach with one hand but still be tough enough to stay in place when you slide it into a backpack. Engineers designed different magnet combinations, then tested their effectiveness with machines that record the force and distance needed to remove the pen. The team then tweaked their tests and designs to make sure there was a consistent feel on every single Surface Pro.\n\nThis same testing is used for the hinge design and magnetic keyboard. Microsoft has created a variety of tests to measure pass and fail rates on prototypes of keyboards to make sure they can attach at multiple angles. That’s particularly important on a smaller keyboard, and it’s something I’m going to be testing myself when I review the Surface Pro 12-inch.\n\nMicrosoft has also been obsessing over performance and battery life on its Qualcomm-powered Surface Laptop devices over the past year, touting them as MacBook Air killers. While the new Surface Pro has moved to a fanless design, Microsoft is sticking with a fan on the new 13-inch Surface Laptop to help cool the chips inside and provide competitive performance. As there’s a fan inside, Microsoft has had to simulate airflow through the cooling system to ensure its prototypes are hitting their targets without throttling too soon.\n\nThe smoke test lets Surface engineers see how airflow is working on a Surface Laptop 13-inch. Image: Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nSurface engineers use smoke to do this, much like how a number of PC gaming YouTubers demonstrate the airflow of modern case designs in the same way. Smoke gets pumped through the intake vents and outputs through the rear to show where the airflow might be getting blocked by a part of the device and not performing as optimally as possible. Airflow is even more important on a smaller device, where the thermals are more constrained.\n\nOnce Microsoft’s engineers are happy with the level of cooling, the fan prototype then gets tested inside a thermal chamber. The temperature is set to 35 degrees Celsius, around 95 Fahrenheit, to see how well the fan and cooling performs at this kind of heat. Microsoft measures areas like the palm rest part of a laptop to ensure they’re staying within the thermal limits and that the device is still comfortable to use. Engineers also look at hot spots with FLIR thermal imaging cameras to ensure the laptop isn’t overheating anywhere.\n\nPrecision thermal and Surface Pen tests are interesting, but they’re not as much fun as good old-fashioned real-world violence. Microsoft showed me how it experiments with its Surface devices by dropping them and smashing them up. I haven’t seen a drop test on a Surface lab tour since the early days of Microsoft’s tablets, so I was pleased to see the company was brave enough to attempt one again.\n\nA drop chamber is designed to validate Microsoft’s simulation data against the reality of dropping a device on concrete flooring. The drop chamber was key to developing Microsoft’s removable battery packs on its latest Surface devices, for example, to ensure any drops wouldn’t puncture the batteries.\n\nMicrosoft says that dropping its Surface Pro 12-inch from a height of two meters onto a hardwood floor does not cause any significant damage, but when it demonstrated the same test on a concrete floor it dented in front of my eyes. It was still functional, but part of the chassis had buckled under the pressure of the concrete. A few years ago I accidentally dropped a Surface Pro review unit in a similar way and the screen cracked, so hopefully these drop tests mean the latest model is even sturdier than before.\n\nWhen Microsoft isn’t busy dropping Surface prototypes, engineers also zap its tablets and laptops with electrical discharges. This ensures you don’t have any weird experiences with electrostatic discharges that could lead to software crashing or even a USB port failing. Microsoft tests above regulatory limits to make sure that extreme scenarios won’t kill its hardware. The company also has a special radio frequency chamber to test frequency interference in a sealed room.\n\nMy favorite part of the Surface labs tour was seeing Microsoft’s robots in action. The company has robots set up to tap the screens of its Surface prototypes 8,000 times to ensure the whole touch panel works every time and no touches are misregistered or inaccurate. The robot can even change the tool used to tap a screen to simulate different finger shapes.\n\nA robot creates a sketch of Microsoft’s 50th anniversary logo on a Surface Pro tablet. Image: Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nOne room where I was led was full of robots, small and large. In the corner a larger robot was busy swiping away on a Surface screen to test that gestures work correctly. A few steps away another one made me smile while using the Surface Pen to draw. As it was Microsoft’s 50th anniversary, a robot arm was drawing a doodle to celebrate the company’s milestone. Smaller robots in the same room were testing palm rejection and tilting with the pen. If the robots ever do rise up, I wouldn’t want to be working in this room, that’s for sure.\n\nAfter admiring the robots, Microsoft led me into one of the quietest places on Earth: an anechoic chamber, which used to hold the world record for the world’s quietest place. The room is suspended and isolated from the room it’s inside of, which is also isolated away from the noise of Microsoft’s Surface buildings. Microsoft uses this room for audio testing, and it left me feeling like my ears were blocked up.\n\nI stood inside the anechoic chamber to hear how audio plays on Microsoft’s range of Surface Laptops, which have no visible speakers. Instead, audio is pumped out through the keyboard, something that’s unusual for a laptop. The audio team has had to tweak the design of the keyboard on the new 13-inch Surface Laptop so it doesn’t rattle or resonate when it’s pushing sound out the tiny gaps between the keys and the chassis. Microsoft could have just added regular speakers to its Surface laptops, but the team decided to engineer something clever to make extra space for the row of function keys.\n\nThat kind of attention to detail really sums up everything about Microsoft’s approach to hardware design with Surface. Over the past decade Microsoft has pushed the boundaries of what to expect from PC design, particularly with products like the Surface Book or Surface Studio.\n\nThese latest Surface devices may have only shrunk in size, but Microsoft’s lab tour demonstrated that there’s still a lot of engineering required to make them smaller. I really hope Microsoft’s meticulous approach to developing this new pair of Surface devices is a sign that the company is still committed to pushing the boundaries of hardware innovation — something Surface has become known for — to bring us more interesting and category-defining designs in the future.\n\nI’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at notepad@theverge.com if you want to discuss anything else.

        "description": "Microsoft will stop supporting the operating system later this year. If you’re still running Windows 10, here are your options.",

        "publishedAt": "2025-05-09T11:30:00Z",
        "full_text": "The end is nigh—at least, it is for Windows 10. Microsoft will stop supporting the decade-old operating system on October 14, 2025.\n\nThere's one hiccup, though: Even though Windows 11 is a free update, more people still use Windows 10 than Windows 11, according to statcounter.com, a site that tracks operating system usage worldwide.\n\nPlenty of people, it seems, either don't want to upgrade to Windows 11 or are using devices that aren't supported. This means millions of people could be using an operating system that’s no longer receiving security updates.\n\nIf you're one of them, it makes sense to learn what happens to your computer in October—and what you should do about it. Here's a summary of what's happening with Windows 10 and four options you have to replace it.\n\nWindows 10 Will Keep Working (But It Will Be Less Secure)\n\nNothing in particular is going to happen on October 14, the day updates stop. Your computer will keep working the way it has, and you're unlikely to run into issues. That doesn't mean it's a great idea to keep using Windows 10, though.\n\nThat's because the system will no longer receive security updates or patches from Microsoft. This won't matter much until a new Windows exploit is discovered. After that, though, your device will have vulnerabilities that will never be patched. At that point, you will be at increased risk of attacks like ransomware, where a virus encrypts all of your files and scammers demand a payment in order to decrypt them. Continuing to use Windows 10 long-term dramatically increases the odds of these and other attacks.\n\nThere are other potential annoyances. Third-party developers, meaning the companies that make the software you use and the games you play, tend to stop providing updates for operating systems that are no longer officially supported. So, if a game adds new features in an update, you might not be able to install it. The same goes for the software you rely on to do your work: Over time, the latest versions of your desktop apps won't run on Windows 10, meaning you'll miss out on features. There's also a security angle. In addition to no longer receiving security updates for your operating system, you'll also eventually stop getting security updates for the tools you use.\n\nNone of this will happen right away on October 14. But you can expect to start hearing about software makers dropping support for Windows 10 later this year. It's a good idea, then, to be prepared.\n\nMicrosoft has two official recommendations: updating your computer to Windows 11, which is free provided your computer supports it. The other recommendation is to buy a new device, presumably one already running Windows 11. Those aren't your only choices, though. You could replace Windows with another operating system entirely, like ChromeOS or Linux. Let's talk through all four options.\n\nOption 1: Try to Install Windows 11\n\nThe simplest thing, for most people, is to upgrade to Windows 11. Yes, this is annoying if you prefer Windows 10, but the good news is that Windows 11 is free, and the irritating AI features are easy to turn off.\n\nFind out whether your computer supports Windows 11 by opening Settings. Head to Settings > Privacy and Security > Windows Update. If your computer is compatible you should see an Upgrade to Windows 11 option. From there, you can click it to start the update procedure. Note that it's generally a good idea to back up your computer before upgrading your operating system."

        "full_text": "is a senior editor and author of Notepad , who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.\n\nMicrosoft has been instructing engineers working on its AI infrastructure to get ready to host Elon Musk’s Grok AI model, according to a trusted source familiar with the plans. In recent weeks Microsoft has been in discussions with xAI to host the Grok AI model and make it available to customers and Microsoft’s own product teams through the Azure cloud service. The move could prove controversial internally and further inflame tensions with Microsoft’s partner OpenAI.\n\nI’m told that if the deal proceeds, Grok will be available on Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft’s AI development platform that gives developers access to AI services, tools, and pre-built models in order to build AI applications and agents. This will allow developers to tap into Grok and use it within their apps, and for Microsoft to potentially use the AI model across its own apps and services. Microsoft refused to comment for this story.\n\nMicrosoft has been steadily growing its Azure AI Foundry business over the past year, and has been quick to embrace models from a variety of AI labs that compete with Microsoft’s partner OpenAI. DeepSeek, the Chinese startup that shook up the world of AI earlier this year, forced Microsoft to move quickly to embrace its supercheap R1 model. The DeepSeek deployment on Azure AI Foundry was unusually fast for Microsoft, as I reported previously in Notepad, with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella moving with haste to get engineers to test and deploy R1 in a matter of days.\n\nI understand Nadella has been pushing for Microsoft to host Grok, as he’s eager for Microsoft to be seen as the hosting provider for any popular or emerging AI models. Microsoft’s Azure AI teams are constantly having to onboard new models or procure hardware that unlocks even more AI capabilities, in Microsoft’s bid to build an AI platform and turn AI agents into a digital workforce.\n\n“All of the systems that we’ve built for 50 years need to apply to AI agents,” said Asha Sharma, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s AI platform, in an interview with The Verge last month. “For Azure AI Foundry we’re thinking about how we evolve to become the operating system on the backend of every single agent.”\n\nMaking Grok available to developers through Azure is part of Microsoft’s goal to become that important infrastructure and platform behind AI models and AI agents, but it doesn’t mean AI labs are turning to Microsoft for their AI model training needs. xAI chief Elon Musk reportedly canceled a potential $10 billion server deal with Oracle last year, and posted on X at the time that xAI would be moving to train its future models “internally” instead of relying on Oracle servers.\n\nIt’s not clear if Microsoft will secure an exclusive deal on hosting the Grok AI model, or whether competitors like Amazon will also be able to host the model. I understand that Microsoft is looking at only providing capacity to host the Grok model, and not the servers for training future models.\n\nMicrosoft’s move to host Musk’s Grok AI model could create some tension internally at the company, particularly given his involvement in the controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) project. Musk has said he will step back from his work at DOGE at some point this month, and an announcement of Grok on Azure may well come at Microsoft’s Build developer conference on May 19th.\n\nBeyond DOGE concerns, hosting Grok could also further inflame tensions in Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI. The ChatGPT maker countersued Musk earlier this month over claims that the Tesla boss is using “bad-faith tactics to slow down OpenAI.” Elon Musk and OpenAI have been in a rather public spat, stemming from Musk’s messy breakup with the AI lab he helped to co-found.\n\nAt the same time, there have been multiple reports of tensions between Microsoft and OpenAI over capacity requirements and access to AI models. Just this week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Nadella and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are “drifting apart,” and that Nadella’s hiring of Mustafa Suleyman last year was an “insurance policy against Altman and OpenAI.”\n\nSuleyman and his Microsoft AI team have reportedly been working on building AI models that can compete directly with OpenAI, but without much success. That’s led to Microsoft continuing to rely on OpenAI for most of its AI features in Office and Copilot. I understand Microsoft had also been anticipating OpenAI’s GPT-5 model this month, but OpenAI’s schedule has been all over the place in recent weeks with delays to new model announcements and capacity issues after the success of its upgraded image generation. It’s now unlikely that GPT-5 will appear this month, I’m told.\n\nHosting Grok on Azure is another clear sign that Microsoft is willing to look elsewhere for AI models. Microsoft-owned GitHub Copilot already supports models from Anthropic and Google, in addition to OpenAI. So, it’s not inconceivable that one day the main Copilot will also let you pick from a variety of competing AI models, especially if it helps further Microsoft’s ambition to become the number one destination for AI developers and users.\n\nThe pad:"

        "full_text": "This comes as Xbox just announced another multiplatform remaster with the original Gears of War, and ahead of the launch of Doom: The Dark Ages next week. What started as a trickle of Xbox games on the PS5 has turned into a flood.\n\nThis, of course, is a great thing for players, with major game releases available on more platforms. But it’s also part of a slow and steady shift for the platform holders, which once heavily relied on exclusives as a means to move hardware. That’s still largely the case for Nintendo — don’t expect to see Mario Kart World anywhere but the Switch 2 — but Microsoft and Sony have been steadily pushing in another direction.\n\nWhile Sony has yet to release a first-party game on a rival console, it has made the PC a major part of its current strategy, with notable releases like Spider-Man 2 and soon The Last of Us Part II launching on PC after their PlayStation debuts. Part of the goal, according to Sony, is to use these PC games to eventually lure players back to their console.\n\nMicrosoft’s strategy has similarly been gradual, but more expansive. It started with four smaller titles, including Grounded and Hi-Fi Rush, last February, and covered both the PS5 and Nintendo Switch. And at the time Xbox chief Phil Spencer told The Verge that “I don’t want to create a false expectation on those other platforms that this is somehow the first four to get over the dam and then the dam’s going to open and that everything else is coming, that’s not the plan today. I also don’t want to mislead customers on those other platforms.”\n\nWell, the dam seems to have burst. Major Xbox releases like Age of Empires and Indiana Jones have made their way to the PS5, while upcoming games like Doom, Gears, and The Outer Worlds 2 are also launching on Sony’s console. Not every first-party Xbox game has been announced for the PS5 — Avowed and South of Midnight are still Xbox exclusives, for now, as is Starfield — but many of the heavy hitters have, including the likes of Gears, which has long been heavily associated with the Xbox brand.\n\nIt seems pretty clear that Microsoft is still in something of an experimentation phase, seeing how different kinds of games perform on different platforms. And as selling increasingly expensive hardware becomes less of a focus for the publisher, the success of those games will be key. Last year, when this initiative was still getting started, Spencer said that the long-term goal was “a future where every screen is an Xbox.” Based on the current sales charts, it seems that now includes a PlayStation."

If a person can use the app, the agent can too.”\n\nThe new computer use tool in Copilot Studio.

This new tool will even detect when buttons and screens change in apps or websites and continue working without failing or breaking, according to Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft added a similar feature, dubbed Actions, to its consumer Copilot earlier this month. Actions can be performed in the background while you work on other tasks. Copilot can now do things like book restaurant reservations, event tickets, and purchase items from online stores. The Actions experience is limited to a number of partners though, and it sounds like Copilot Studio will be free to work with more websites and apps."

You’ll also be able to use this assistant to download and install games on your Xbox console.\n\nThe setup experience for Microsoft’s gaming Copilot. Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge\n\nMuch like the existing Copilot, you can type to this Xbox chatbot or use voice to ask questions. You can also pick between a variety of voices: energetic, wise, chill, or heroic. Microsoft is also working on Copilot characters that will be animated versions of the AI assistant, but this isn’t present in the Xbox version yet.\n\nMicrosoft is also working on more features for its Copilot for Gaming experience in general, with ambitions to use its Copilot Vision feature to let the AI assistant see what you see during games on a PC. This will, if Microsoft can pull it off, eventually allow Copilot to fully guide you through games and offer tips on how to play titles like Overwatch 2 or Minecraft.\n\nThis initial Copilot for Gaming feature will be available to Xbox Insiders soon, and Microsoft plans to tweak it constantly based on feedback from Xbox players. It’s not clear when this gaming Copilot will appear on Xbox consoles though, but I’d imagine it’s a while away given that Microsoft has only just started testing Copilot inside the Xbox mobile app.\n\nI’m interested to hear what feedback Microsoft gets about Copilot for Gaming, particularly because it will debut as a feature inside the Xbox mobile app. I’m not sure why I’d use a chatbot to download and install Xbox games or check my achievements, but if Microsoft can actually turn this into an AI gaming coach then that would certainly pique my interest.\n\nXbox games keep appearing on Battle.net\n\nBlizzard’s PC launcher, Battle.net, used to only have a handful of games available to download and install, but it’s quickly becoming Microsoft’s launcher of choice for new and existing Xbox games. Avowed launched on Battle.net recently, and now Sea of Thieves is heading to the launcher next month.\n\nWhat’s interesting about these two additions is that they’re not Activision or Blizzard games, and both are available for Game Pass subscribers.You had to use the Xbox app or Microsoft Store to access Game Pass titles on PC previously, but by opening them up to Battle.net, Microsoft is signaling that it might be open to enabling Game Pass access on more PC launchers.\n\nThis isn’t just two games, either. Doom: The Dark Ages and The Outer Worlds 2 are also coming to Battle.net at launch, and Game Pass subscribers will be able to get these through this launcher, too. The downloads are fully managed by the Battle.net client instead of being handed off to the Microsoft Store, and all you need to do is link your accounts to get access to Game Pass titles.\n\nI doubt this means Microsoft will fully move away from the Microsoft Store and Xbox app for Game Pass installs. But with millions of Battle.net users, it does mean the company can offer up more choices for how people obtain and play Xbox games. The Battle.net launcher is certainly another opportunity to sell PC players on PC Game Pass or Xbox Play Anywhere titles.\n\nIf you know more about Microsoft’s Battle.net plans, you can reach me via email at notepad@theverge.com or speak to me confidentially on the Signal messaging app, where I’m tomwarren.01.\n\nThe pad:\n\nI’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at notepad@theverge.com if you want to discuss anything else.

These “AirBorne” vulnerabilities have all been patched—including some that potentially impacted Apple’s Mac computers—but, in practice, third-party devices may not all get fixes, and even if they do, patch adoption could be low.\n\nRecords reviewed by WIRED show that utilizing car subscription features can substantially raise your risk of being subjected to government surveillance, because such services generate troves of data that are valuable to law enforcement. WIRED also did a deep dive on North Korea’s yearslong campaign to place IT workers inside companies in North American, the United Kingdom, and Europe. The schemes are more effective than ever as scammers incorporate AI into their workflows.\n\nWhatsApp designed a special cloud processing platform called Private Processing to allow new AI tools to work in the secure messenger without compromising its end-to-end encryption. Experts warn, though, that it could create enticing targets for hackers.

Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nThree separate retailers in the UK—including the supermarket Co-op and thedepartment stores Marks & Spencer and Harrods—have all revealed they have recently been subject to cyberattacks, with the intrusions and widespread impact seemingly ongoing. Toward the end of April, Marks & Spencer revealed it had been the victim of a “cyber incident.” Over the following two weeks, it has been forced to pause online orders within its apps, some food has been missing from its shelves, and it has paused recruitment and other “normal processes.” Staff at Co-op have been told to keep webcams turned on during remote meetings and check who is attending calls, after shutting down parts of its IT systems in response to its own hack. Harrods, meanwhile, told customers to “not do anything differently at this point.”\n\nAt the time of writing, none of the retailers have detailed the specific nature of the cyberattacks or the full scale of the impacts. It is also unclear if the attacks are linked. Bloomberg has reported a ransomware cartel dubbed DragonForce has claimed it and its partners were behind the attacks. The so-called cartel provides “infrastructure and tools” to hackers but “doesn't require affiliates to deploy its ransomware,” according to research from security firm Secureworks. The hacked companies did not respond to Bloomberg about the claims.\n\nBleeping Computer originally reported that the threat actors known as Scattered Spider were allegedly behind the attack on Marks & Spencer. The publication reported that the company’s servers were encrypted by ransomware, with the intrusion beginning as early as February. The attribution to Scattered Spider has not been confirmed by Marks & Spencer."

Recall, a feature that screenshots almost everything you do on a Copilot Plus PC, will be available today alongside an improved AI-powered Windows search interface and a new Click to Do feature that’s very similar to Google’s Circle to Search.\n\nRecall was originally supposed to launch at the same time as Copilot Plus PCs in June last year, but the feature was delayed following concerns raised by security researchers. Microsoft then planned to start publicly testing Recall in October, but pushed it back again to November to have more time to secure it further. Microsoft has now spent the past 10 months overhauling the security of Recall and making it an opt-in experience that you don’t have to enable if you’re concerned about the privacy implications.\n\nThe Recall timeline lets you scroll through all the snapshots of your PC. Image: Microsoft\n\n“When we introduced Recall, we set out to address a common frustration: picking up where you left off,“ explains Navjot Virk, corporate vice president of Windows Experiences at Microsoft. Recall is designed to improve how you search your PC, but taking snapshots that are categorized so it’s easy to search for vague memories instead of file names.\n\nI spent a few weeks testing Recall last year and found it was creepy, clever, and compelling. Technologically it’s a great improvement to the Windows search interface, because it can understand images and content in a much more natural way. But it does create a privacy minefield because you’re suddenly storing a lot more information on your PC usage, and you still need to manage blocked apps and websites carefully.\n\nKevin Beaumont, one of the security researchers that first raised alarm bells over Recall, has been testing the final version recently and found that “Microsoft has made serious efforts to try to secure Recall.” The database is now encrypted, Recall attempts to filter sensitive data by default, and the feature is now an opt-in experience.\n\nBeaumont does note that filtering sensitive apps and websites can be hit-and-miss though, and occasionally even buggy. He also says that you can access Recall through a simple four-digit PIN unlock option with Windows Hello, instead of it forcing more secure facial recognition or a fingerprint. Microsoft’s Recall website claims “you must have at least one biometric sign-in option enabled for Windows Hello, either facial recognition or a fingerprint, to launch and use Recall.”\n\nThe new AI-powered Windows search interface. Image: Microsoft\n\nAlongside Recall, Windows search is also getting some AI improvements on Copilot Plus PCs today. You can now use the File Explorer, Windows search box, or settings with natural language queries. That means instead of searching for file names or specific settings, you can now describe images or documents and get results. If you’re looking for an image of a brown dog you know you have saved somewhere, you can just ask for “brown dog” rather than having to know the file name or date the image was created.\n\nMicrosoft is also rolling out Click to Do today, which works a lot like Google’s Circle to Search. You activate it by using the Windows key + left mouse click, and it will provide actions for the text or images that are on your screen. This includes summarizing text or being able to quickly remove an object from an image.\n\nClick to Do lets you take actions on images and text. Image: Microsoft\n\nRecall, the improved Windows search, and Click to Do will all be available today across all Copilot Plus PCs, but the text actions in Click to Do are currently limited to Qualcomm-powered devices, with AMD- and Intel-powered Copilot Plus PCs getting this feature “in the next few months.” Recall and Click to Do should be available in a variety of languages and regions, but Microsoft says both features won’t be available in EU countries and Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway until later this year."

        "full_text": "“When I knew it was over was when I downloaded Skype.”\n\nAll the way back in 2003, Michael Powell, then the chairman of the FCC and the United States’ chief regulator of the telecom industry, told a roomful of academics and executives at the University of California at San Diego that he had seen the future of communication. “When the inventors of Kazaa are distributing, for free, a little program that you can talk to anybody else, and the quality is fantastic and it’s free, it’s over. You can pretend it’s not. You can fight these fights. But it is over. The world will change now inevitably.”\n\nPowell was right. The world did change, and it changed in Skype’s image. Then it left Skype behind.\n\nOn Monday, Microsoft shut Skype down for good, a few days short of 14 years after buying the service for $8.5 billion. Skype still had users until the bitter end, but both Microsoft and the world had more or less moved on. Microsoft has shifted all its investment to Teams, a corporate-focused app that the company swears will someday catch on with regular people. Zoom and Meet and countless other apps do video chat perfectly well. WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, and dozens of other messaging services offer high-quality video and audio in addition to text. The technology that made Skype special two decades ago is now utterly commoditized, and maybe the world just no longer needed the company that made it all possible.\n\nI would happily trade most of what’s available in modern messaging apps for the Skype feature set circa about 2007\n\nBut before it goes offline for good, let’s just quickly give Skype its due. No company before or since has had an idea about communication as fundamentally correct as Skype: that what the internet needed was an all-in-one communication system. With Skype, you could call other Skype users, obviously. But you could also call anyone with a phone number. You often had to pay for it, but still: that idea alone remains the most ambitious thing anyone’s ever done in internet chat. Skype’s founders understood that they weren’t building a platform — they were building a global communication system.\n\nSkype in early 2007. Image: Skype / Internet Archive\n\nI would happily trade most of what’s available in modern messaging apps for the Skype feature set circa about 2007. You could make high-quality calls over voice and video, to practically anyone anywhere on the planet. You could send instant messages to other Skype users, or SMS messages to anyone with a phone. Your Skype account had an answering machine, so people could leave you messages. With Skypecasts, you could have up to 100 people in a single moderated call. Skype was available on every platform that mattered, and its quality was unbeatable.\n\nAt its peak, Skype was enormous. In 2009, The New York Times reported the app had 405 million users, and accounted for 8 percent of all the world’s international calling minutes. Skype was a verb! You didn’t call someone from your laptop, you Skyped them. And its ringtone remains one of the most iconic internet sounds of all time.\n\nUltimately, it seems that what killed Skype was the very thing that made it so powerful all those years ago: its peer-to-peer technology, borrowed from the file-sharing platform Kazaa (its founders previous startup), that connected users directly to each other instead of hosting everything on the internet. This made it vastly easier and cheaper to scale the service when bandwidth was still hugely expensive, but caused trouble over time. Only a few people truly understood how it worked, one early Skype employee told me, and as Skype was growing there was hardly any incentive to re-architect the whole system. After a while, the system became so specialized, and tuned to so many edge cases, that it began to collapse under its own weight. Pivoting Skype to an internet-based system, which Microsoft eventually did, was a huge amount of work.\n\nSkype’s outdated tech became a particular problem when mobile platforms became dominant. It both obviated some of Skype’s coolest features — I now have a thousand different ways to ping your phone, with or without your phone number — and killed some of the appeal of the peer-to-peer tech. P2P requires devices to be always on and always connected; the way mobile phones are architected just doesn’t allow an app to stay awake all the time. And that’s not even counting all the vagaries of mobile networks around the world.\n\nSkype turned into a knockoff of a bunch of better social apps\n\nAt the same time, though, Microsoft didn’t always help Skype’s chances. For a while, Microsoft appeared all-in: the company already had a popular messaging service, Windows Live Messenger, but retired that in 2012 to focus on Skype. But then, “Instead of refining the product, the focus shifted to cramming in features and maximizing the number of users Microsoft could pull in,” Bartosz Jaworski, a former product manager at Skype, wrote in a blog post after the shutdown was announced. Microsoft added a bunch of features nobody really cared about, inexplicably created a new app called Skype Qik, and launched a full redesign that went over so badly Microsoft had to redesign it again a year later.\n\nAfter a while, the app that had once been so far in front of its competition turned into a knockoff of a bunch of better social apps. By 2016, when Teams launched, it became obvious that Microsoft would focus more on its business-friendly brand than its renegade consumer platform. When the Covid pandemic hit in 2020, Skype’s user numbers jumped, but Zoom took its place as the video-chat app of choice. That was Skype’s last chance to stay relevant, and probably the last nail in its coffin. Microsoft has little use for a free consumer chat app, and none for a second-tier one. The business of consumer chat is a tough one — it might not even exist, at least on its own — and so eventually everything goes commercial.\n\nRelated The Verge looks back on Skype\n\nWhat we’re stuck with now is just a bunch of platforms. Zoom is trying desperately to become Microsoft Office; Google Meet and Microsoft Teams are just features inside their companies’ larger work platforms. WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, and the rest are closed ecosystems. Your phone number has become a sort of universal username, but it still means we’re all stuck with a dozen chat apps on our phone just to talk with our friends. And sure, if you want the lowest possible quality and worst possible feature set, you can always make phone calls and send text messages. Apple’s iMessage system is probably the closest thing to a spiritual Skype successor in terms of its ability to work with lots of technologies, but that comes with plenty of its own problems and lock-in issues.\n\nAll those years ago, Skype was right: we don’t need another social platform or suite of work apps. We need a new layer for communication on the internet. We need something that operates between apps and devices, that doesn’t care where you’ve registered an account. We need something that doesn’t force us to put all our trust in a company that has quarterly results to worry about. What I’m describing is probably a terrible business, and a force for good on the internet. Skype was ultimately very much both those things. I stopped using it years ago, but I’ll miss it anyway."

Initially, he and his ex-wife Melinda had planned for the Gates Foundation to continue working for several decades after their deaths.\n\nWhen asked about this shift, Mr Gates told the BBC's Newshour on Thursday that there will be other wealthy people in 20 years who can better tackle future challenges.\n\n\"It's really about the urgency,\" he said. \"We can spend a lot more if we're not trying to be perpetual, and I know that the spending will be in line with my values.\"\n\nGiving away 99% of his fortune could still leave Mr Gates a billionaire – according to Bloomberg, the Microsoft founder is the fifth-richest person in the world.\n\nIn the blog post, he shared a timeline of his wealth that showed his current net worth at $108bn and a large hand-drawn arrow going down to close to zero in 2045.\n\nMr Gates also said the foundation would draw from its endowment to give away $200bn.\n\nAlong with Paul Allen, Mr Gates founded Microsoft in 1975, and the company became a dominant force in computer software and other tech industries. Mr Gates has gradually stepped back from the company this century, resigning as chief executive in 2000 and as chairman in 2014.\n\nHe said he has been inspired to give away money by investor Warren Buffett and other philanthropists, however critics of his foundation say Mr Gates uses its charitable status to avoid tax and that it has undue influence over the global health system.\n\nIn his blog post, he outlined three main goals for his foundation: eliminating preventable diseases which kill mothers and children; eliminating infectious diseases including malaria and measles; and eliminating poverty for hundreds of millions of people.\n\nMr Gates criticised the US, UK and France for cutting their foreign aid budgets.\n\n\"It's unclear whether the world's richest countries will continue to stand up for its poorest people,\" he wrote. \"But the one thing we can guarantee is that, in all of our work, the Gates Foundation will support efforts to help people and countries pull themselves out of poverty.\"\n\nHe was more pointed in the interview with Newshour, where he was asked about comments he had made accusing tech billionaire Elon Musk of killing children through cuts to US aid made by Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge.\n\n\"These cuts will kill not just children, but millions of children,\" Mr Gates replied.\n\n\"You wouldn't have expected the world's richest person to do it.\"\n\nIn his interview with the BBC's Newshour, Mr Gates raised the issue of cancelled grants to a hospital in Gaza Province, Mozambique, which Donald Trump erroneously claimed was funding condoms \"for Hamas\" in the Gaza Strip. Mr Musk later acknowledged the claim was wrong and said \"we will make mistakes\", however the cost-cutting continued.\n\n\"I'm disappointed that [Musk] made abrupt cuts and characterised them in a way that was unfair, including saying that, money was being spent in Gaza when in fact, it was money to prevent mothers from infecting their babies with HIV,\" Mr Gates said.\n\n\"I mean, this is serious stuff,\" he continued.\n\nThe BBC has contacted Mr Musk for comment.\n\nThe Gates Foundation is a donor to BBC Media Action, the BBC's charitable arm which is separate from the Corporation's news operations."

        "full_text": "Notion is launching the third app in its suite of work tools, an email app called Notion Mail. (The other two, of course, are Notion Calendar and Notion itself.) The app, available now for web and Mac and in testing for iOS, is the next step in Notion’s attempt to compete with Microsoft Office and Google Workspace. Notion wants to be the hub for all your work, and it knows that means getting email right.\n\nI’ve been testing Notion Mail for the last few days, and the app is roughly what I expected so far. It looks nice, trading Gmail’s countless menus and inscrutable buttons for a simple, text-first look. It’s very customizable, too: you can change what appears in your inbox and in what order, show more or less information with each message, toggle dark and light mode, and more. “We’re thinking about it from a Notion perspective,” says Jason Ginsberg, one of the leaders on the Notion Mail team. (Ginsberg and Andrew Milich founded a productivity tools company called Skiff, which was acquired by Notion last year.)\n\nOne of Notion Mail’s most powerful features is its AI-powered organization. When you set up the app, it asks whether you’d like to automatically sort things like promotional emails or calendar invites into their own section. Useful, certainly, but so far so Gmail. When you open an email, though, a button appears at the top of the thread prompting you to “auto label similar.” If you click it, Notion’s AI will crawl through your inbox looking for other messages like it — not just matching sender or subject line, but by actually determining what’s in the email and what you might care about. You can also create a label with a chatbot-style prompt. Either way, the app presents you with some guesses, and you pick which ones should and shouldn’t be labeled together with your current thread. From then on, any new email that fits the category gets labeled automatically.\n\nThe AI labeler isn’t perfect, but it’s very handy. I clicked the button on an email containing a receipt, and Notion Mail went and found a bunch of other receipts to label, as well. (It also found a couple of unrelated emails from Chase and eBay, but those were easy enough to turn off.) Once I hit save, I was presented with a new “Payment Receipt” section in Notion Mail showing all my receipts. Well, not all: there’s no obvious way to go back in time and comb through everything, so now I have a whopping two days of receipts collated together.\n\nNotion calls these separate sections “Views,” and they’re one of the more powerful parts of Notion Mail. “Think of each view as a collection of filters,” Milich says, “that you can combine however you want.” You could have one that combines all your confirmation emails and receipts in one mega-travel space. You could have another for all your newsletters, as well as one just for your must-reads. These views sync back to the Gmail interface as labels, and they don’t mess with the sanctity of your inbox, but they do offer a new way to put things together. It’s a little like the idea behind Google Inbox, but much less in your face.\n\nAs you start to use the app, you start to uncover more of Notion Mail’s features. (One gripe I have with the app so far: it hides a lot of what it can do, arguably for too long, in the name of simple design.) You can use Notion-style slash commands to format text and also to insert a built-in scheduling tool connected to your calendar, or a template that can automatically add information like a Zoom link or your recipient’s first name. Notion’s AI can even write and edit your emails, if you like. You can find most things with a CMD-K shortcut to bring up the command bar, but many of them are pretty hidden otherwise.\n\nThere are some bugs and missing features in this first version. It only works with Gmail accounts, for one thing, and Milich wouldn’t give me a date for Outlook or other account support. It’s also missing Windows and all mobile platforms — there’s an iOS app coming soon, it appears, but the rest are likely to be further behind. Even beyond all that, I wish Notion Mail would let you see multiple mail accounts at once; switching between them is just annoying. I’ve seen others report attachments behaving strangely or disappearing altogether, though I haven’t had that issue myself.\n\nIn general, the app makes perfect sense for Notion. The idea, Milich says, was to “reinvent the core idea of the inbox. It’s not this never-ending list. It’s a database you can filter, sort, organize, in the Notion building-block model. It’s like an app you can customize.” It’s not a complete reinvention of the whole email system, just a bunch of new ways to interact with and make sense of everything in that system. That idea has worked awfully well for Notion as a whole and works for my inbox so far, too."

        "full_text": "Get ready to pay more for Xbox consoles and some games. Microsoft raised the recommended retail pricing of its Xbox Series S/X consoles, controllers and headsets on Thursday. The company also announced then that it plans to raise the prices new first-party games from $70 to $80 this holiday season, matching the cost of some new Nintendo Switch 2 games.\n\nMicrosoft said the cost of games released between now and then won't increase, so Doom: The Dark Ages won't see a price hike when it's released later this month, for instance. \"We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development,\" Microsoft wrote.\n\nWatch this: Xbox Announces Serious Price Hikes | Obvious Skill Issue Ep 3 05:49\n\nMicrosoft's recommended retail pricing (PDF) for consoles and controllers is staggering. The company is suggesting an $80 price hike for the Xbox Series S (512GB), the most affordable Xbox console Microsoft sells. That takes the price of the 5-year-old console from $300 to $380. The Xbox Series X (1TB) is getting a $100 increase, increasing it from $500 to $600. And the Xbox Series X (2TB) Galaxy Black Special Edition now costs $730, which makes the eye-watering $700 price tag of a PlayStation 5 Pro seem reasonable.\n\nRead more: Who's to Blame for the Rising Cost of Nintendo Switch 2 Games?\n\nThe base Xbox wireless controller has a recommended price of $65 (up from $60), and the high-end Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 has a recommended price of $200 (up from $145). Stereo and wireless headsets have recommended prices of $65 (up from $60) and $120 (up from $110), respectively.\n\nGame Pass Ultimate is one of the best values in gaming today. Microsoft/CNET\n\nThese prices aren't just affecting gamers in the US. Microsoft raised Xbox console and accessory hardware prices in the UK, EU, Australia and the rest of the world. But the cost of headsets is only increasing in the US and Canada. You could see these console and hardware price hikes immediately, but Microsoft isn't raising the price of Xbox Game Pass.\n\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate — the most expensive tier of the gaming service — costs $20 a month but provides you with access to hundreds of games, including new, Day 1 releases. With the price of some major games rising to $80, that means you would have to buy four months of Game Pass Ultimate to match the price of one new game. That makes Game Pass much more appealing, but there is the potential for Microsoft to raise the price of the service in the future.\n\nMicrosoft raised Game Pass prices in 2024 alongside the introduction of Game Pass Standard. But since the company raised the price of the service in 2024, and the year prior in 2023, it's possible Microsoft will increase the cost of the service later this year.\n\nAgain, game prices aren't going up until later this year, so you still have time to buy games at or below $70 apiece, but you could see the updated console, controller and headset pricing now. For more on Xbox, you can check out CNET's reviews of the Xbox Series S and the Xbox Series X, as well as what to know about Xbox Game Pass."

The folder is used to manage logs for Internet Information Services, but it appeared even for those who don't have that service turned on.\n\nWhile nothing obvious happened after the folder was deleted, the deletion creates a security vulnerability, according to Microsoft.\n\n\"After installing the updates listed in the Security Updates table for your operating system, a new %systemdrive%\\inetpub folder will be created on your device,\" Microsoft said in a security update. \"This folder should not be deleted regardless of whether Internet Information Services (IIS) is active on the target device.

Microsoft didn't immediately respond to a request for further comment.\n\nWhile it's not clear exactly why the folder is needed, the fact that Microsoft updated its security advisories to elevate the issue shows you should pay attention, said Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at the cybersecurity firm Tenable.\n\n\"It's a bit of a headscratcher, but if Microsoft says it's needed to thwart exploitation somehow, then consumers should take it seriously,\" Narang said in an email.\n\nWhat to do if you deleted the \"inetpub\" folder in Windows\n\nIf you deleted the folder, restoring it by turning on Internet Information Services will fix the vulnerability, according to Windows Latest.\n\nTo do so:\n\nAccess your optional Windows features by going to Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features. Select Turn Windows features on or off. Check the box next to Internet Information Services. Click OK.\n\nYou can open your Windows folder to double-check that \"inetpub\" is back. That's it.\n\nNarang said it's important that the folder has the proper permissions, so reinstating it by installing IIS is the best way to ensure the folder is put back properly. \"Once installed, users can uninstall IIS, as the folder will remain on the system after,\" he said."

        "full_text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nBig Tech is rewriting the rules this year: Top talent gets big rewards, while underperformers face the heat.\n\nThe latest to follow suit is Amazon, which recently overhauled its compensation model to reward long-running top performers with larger payouts. Four years at the highest performance rank now pays off big with 110% of the pay band, which exceeds the previous 100% cap. But employees who achieve the top rank for the first time take a hit, with total comp cut to 70% of the pay range, down from last year's 80%.\n\nThe move is part of a broader tech trend of using performance reviews and compensation to better incentivize high achievers and eliminate underperformers and their drag on the balance book. Big Tech firms, including Google, Microsoft, and Meta, have made similar changes, all in pursuit of leaner, top-tier teams.\n\nThese companies handed out lavish perks, pampering, and sky-high salaries to stay competitive. A pandemic-era hiring spree exacerbated a tech tradition of hoarding top talent and only added to the ranks. Now, a shift makes one thing clear: It's no longer about head count — it's about talent.\n\nThe changes go hand in hand with sweeping pivots across tech to replace perks and pampering with performance and efficiency. Big Tech still rewards workers handsomely, but the era of resting and vesting at the giants may be well and truly over.\n\n\"The industry overall has made big efforts to do more with less,\" Brian Nguyen, a product manager at the salary data platform Levels.fyi, told Business Insider. \"This has allowed them to scale back costs while pushing for higher-quality work with fewer employees and rewards for only the top-tier performers.\"\n\nGoogle declined to comment, and Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA Meta spokesperson reiterated what the company previously shared with BI about its low-performer cuts: \"Employees at Meta have always been held accountable to a goal-based culture of high performance.\"\n\nThe new approach \"creates a steadier compensation progression for employees as they develop within their roles,\" an Amazon spokesperson said, adding the company offers \"multiple channels\" for employees to raise concerns about pay.\n\n'Appropriate distinction'\n\nAmazon managers this year received a list of potential pay-related questions and suggested answers, according to internal talking points obtained by BI. If asked about pay cuts, managers are encouraged to focus on employees getting raises for improved performance.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\n\"Employees moving to a higher OV level will generally receive an increase,\" one talking point said, referring to Amazon's performance rating called overall value. \"This ensures an appropriate distinction between newer and consistently high-performing employees at each OV level.\"\n\nAt Google, a larger share of employees can now earn top performance ratings, which lead to bigger bonuses and equity. Managers have also been given the authority to hand out more discretionary rewards to employees who are excelling.\n\nBut with a fixed budget, those gains come at the cost of lower-ranked employees, reinforcing the company's focus on high performance and raising the stakes for those falling behind.\n\n\"High performance is more important than ever to achieve the goals we've set, and so we're making some changes to further reward top contributors,\" John Casey, Google's vice president of global compensation and benefits, told staff in a memo last week.\n\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, has rolled out policies aimed at enhancing performance management and addressing what the company calls \"low performers.\" Managers also received \"more transparency and clarity\" in the rewards process, an internal note seen by BI said. The change came after the company laid off 2,000 employees deemed to be underperforming earlier this year.\n\nMeta has ramped up what it calls performance-based cuts, aiming to shed about 5% of its lowest-rated staff. An internal memo revealed plans to make these layoffs annual under a \"non-regrettable attrition\" policy. Adding to the sting, some ex-employees — even high performers — have landed on internal block lists, barring them from being rehired.\n\nLower pay for new hires\n\nWhile these companies are weighing an employee's performance rating history more heavily, some are also reducing new-hire offers.\n\nIn 2022, Amazon regularly offered over $300,000 a year to newly hired midlevel software engineers, according to data from Levels.fyi. Nowadays, more offers land around $270,000 a year, with recruiters being especially strict about needing \"extra approvals\" for anything higher, said Levels.fyi's Nguyen. Other companies, like Meta and Apple, are taking a similar approach, he added.\n\nSwitching jobs no longer helps either.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker shows that median pay increases for job switchers dropped to 4.2% in February, down sharply from 7.3% in early 2023.\n\nTech professionals, in particular, are feeling the heat with lower pay offers and significant pay cuts, BI previously reported, as reduced competition has weakened employees' bargaining power.\n\nNot everyone is sold that the shift to crack down on underperformance is here to stay. Peter Capelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told BI that many companies follow these trends simply because \"others are doing them,\" cycling through similar changes every decade or so.\n\n\"These are just fads,\" Capelli said.\n\nStill, the changes haven't gone unnoticed. At one Amazon office, some employees quietly voiced their frustration on an elevator whiteboard, a photo of which was shared with BI.\n\n\"No raise, no RSUs — thanks!\" the whiteboard read, referring to the lack of employee stock awards. \"Do more with less.\""

He put it in the wood chipper, because he didn't go to a party that weekend,\" Gates told the Times of Musk. \"The world's richest man has been involved in the deaths of the world's poorest children.\"\n\nGates also referred to an instance early in President Donald Trump's term in which administration officials said that the US had been sending condoms to Gaza via foreign aid. In reality, the US had been providing contraceptives to a province in the African country of Mozambique.\n\n\"They cut the money to Gaza Province in Mozambique. That is really for drugs, so mothers don't give their babies HIV,\" Gates said. \"But the people doing the cutting are so geographically illiterate, they think it's Gaza and condoms. Will they go meet those babies who got HIV because that money was cut? Probably not.\"\n\nGates made the remarks as he discussed his plans to give away the remainder of his wealth over the next 20 years before closing his foundation in 2045.\n\nThe Gates Foundation has invested heavily in public health initiatives around the world, often focusing on childhood diseases.\n\nThis isn't the first time Gates has been critical of Musk — or vice versa.\n\nGates has argued that Musk has destabilized the politics of foreign countries through his support for right-wing causes in the United Kingdom and Germany. He's also said that while he believes Tesla is having a positive environmental impact, he wishes Musk were more outspoken about the climate crisis.\n\nMusk, in turn, has said that Gates has a \"limited\" understanding of artificial intelligence.\n\nMusk, DOGE, Tesla, and the White House did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider."

        "description": "OpenAI is seeking data center talent as it reduces reliance on Microsoft and ramps up its own infrastructure ambitions.",

        "full_text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nAs OpenAI lessens its reliance on Microsoft, the AI startup is looking to add workers with data center experience to its ranks.\n\nOf the roughly 300 job listings on OpenAI's website at the time of publication, Business Insider counted more than 20 that appeared directly related to data center development. Many of the open jobs involve building out the digital infrastructure that supports OpenAI's technology as the company uses more computing power.\n\nThe infrastructure hiring push comes as the company starts to operate more independently of Microsoft, which had until recently served as OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted Sunday on X about the company's hiring push.\n\n\"If you are interested in infrastructure and very large-scale computing systems, the scale of what's happening at OpenAI right now is insane and we have very hard/interesting challenges. Please consider joining us! We could desperately use your help,\" Altman wrote.\n\nThe open roles cover various functions in departments across the company, from strategic finance to hardware, security, and scaling. One of the job descriptions mentions Stargate, OpenAI's data center venture with Oracle and SoftBank, among others, that plans to spend up to $500 billion on building AI infrastructure. Most of the data center-related roles are in San Francisco, though there are some openings in Seattle and New York. Only two of the jobs are remote-friendly.\n\nWhen asked for comment on this story, Liz Bourgeois, the head of OpenAI's policy communications, directed BI to Altman's post.\n\n\"In particular, if you have thought about how to squeeze max performance out of a system, we'd love to talk to you,\" Altman said on X.\n\nIn October, Microsoft disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it had invested $13 billion in OpenAI. As of its last funding round from investors, including SoftBank, the startup was valued at $300 billion.\n\nOpenAI has been using those funds to start securing graphics processing unit capacity to power its artificial intelligence models directly from third parties and bringing in talent with data center design, construction, and capacity planning experience, the TD Cowen analyst Michael Elias wrote in March in a research note.\n\nOpenAI's data center hires\n\nSome of the jobs OpenAI is hiring for deal directly with building physical data centers. The Stargate team, for instance, is looking for a site selection and enablement leader to oversee the process of determining where to build facilities, negotiating power and land deals, and navigating state and local government hurdles.\n\nThe company is also hiring for a data center design engineer with experience in power and mechanical systems and a data center lead for physical operations and logistics to oversee on-site security and operations.\n\nBetween November and March, OpenAI hired at least three data center leaders, including a director of infrastructure, an infrastructure construction lead, and a strategy and operations leader. The new employees came from Meta, Equinix, and SandboxAQ, an AI and quantum computing startup that spun out of Alphabet.\n\nEarlier this year, Lane Dilg, who was an advisor in then-President Joe Biden's Department of Energy and had been working in global affairs for OpenAI since 2023, transitioned to a role overseeing infrastructure policy and partnerships, according to LinkedIn.\n\nElias said the hires pointed \"to the potential for OpenAI to begin self-building data centers in the medium to long term.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has begun to scale back its data center capacity investments, pausing construction projects and pulling out of leases with third parties."

He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.\n\nRazer is announcing two new mice, the Pro Click V2 and Pro Click V2 Vertical Edition — the latter being Razer’s first vertical mouse design. Both mice are more ergonomic and productivity-focused than the usual gaming-first designs Razer is known for, but the $99.99 Pro Click V2 and $119.99 Vertical Edition feature the brand’s typical all-black designs and bright RGB illumination.\n\nBoth Pro Click V2 mice feature programmable buttons, Razer Chroma compatibility, and Razer’s “AI Prompt Master” for quick access to prompting ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot. The standard model has a 30 degree tiled angle with contoured design for a natural resting position, rubberized side grips, an extended thumb rest, and a free-spinning tiltable scroll wheel for horizontal scrolling. The Vertical Edition goes for a more handshake-like grip with a 71.7 degree angle, big cutout to grip with your thumb, and an extended base that slightly elevates the wrist to reduce strain.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 8 Image: Razer\n\nThe new V2 versions replace the original Pro Click that Razer designed with ergonomic office furniture company Humanscale. That model definitely looked the part of an office productivity tool with its white and gray design. The V2s go harder on the typical Razer gamer aesthetic while still trying to compete with popular ergonomic mice like the Logitech MX Master and MX Vertical."

After years worth of rumors, Bethesda has finally acknowledged that the Oblivion remaster is real. In a post on social media, Bethesda revealed a simple image featuring the roman number IV — alluding to the fact that Oblivion is the fourth in the Elder Scrolls series — and the date and time of April 22nd at 8AM PT. Of course this all means that tomorrow morning, Bethesda will reveal more about the remaster including, hopefully, a release date.\n\nRumors have been circulating about an Oblivion remaster since 2023. The first hints were revealed in documents related to the Federal Trade Commissions case against Microsoft where an Oblivion remaster was mentioned alongside several other planned games including what became Doom: The Dark Ages. Then, last week, images from the alleged remaster leaked on a developer’s website before being swiftly taken down which all but confirmed the game’s existence.\n\nUnless you count Elder Scrolls Online which released its eighth expansion just last year, there hasn’t been a new mainline entry in the Elder Scrolls series since Skyrim in 2011. (Unless you also count Skyrim’s many, many ports for each new console generation since its launch.) Elder Scrolls VI was announced in 2018 but since then, no word on its development. An Oblivion remaster then is perfectly timed to tide fans over while they wait for Todd Howard and the development gang to give them something, anything, on the new game.\n\nYou can watch the Oblivion remaster livestream tomorrow April 22nd at 8AM PT/ 11 AM ET on Bethesda’s Twitch and YouTube channel."

He also said there was many companies building \"strong\" offerings in the race to make AI agents.\n\n\n\nHoffman, who stood down as an OpenAI director in 2023, citing potential conflicts of interest with his other AI investments, was asked about the startup during an interview on Bloomberg Television on Friday.\n\nHe said he was using Deep Research once a day, and that it \"gives you the lens to the amplification we're going to get with these products as workers in the future.\"\n\nThe rise of agentic AI, which can independently act on a person's behalf and make decisions without human intervention, has fuelled speculation about how and when AI might replace human workers.\n\nA group of Carnegie Mellon researchers ran a virtual simulation designed to test how AI agents fare in real-world professional scenarios. They found that the top-performing model finished less than one-quarter of all tasks.\n\n\"While agents may be used to accelerate some portion of the tasks that human workers are doing, they are likely not a replacement for all tasks at the moment,\" Graham Neubig, a computer science professor at CMU and one of the researchers, previously told BI.\n\nHoffman, who cofounded Manas AI, said he saw no clear leader in the race to develop agentic AI, saying there was \"a bunch of folks who are doing very strong things,\" and \"not just OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google.\"\n\nBloomberg interviewer Ed Ludlow told Hoffman he was increasingly talking to AI in voice mode, which he called \"a psychological thing that, as a consumer, you kind of have to get over.\""

Later, it also let users video call each other and send private messages — all for free. It was among the first video conferencing apps and exploded in popularity, at one point boasting more than 300 million users, according to the Washington Post.\n\nIn 2005, eBay purchased Skype for $2.6 billion. eBay then sold its controlling interest to a group of investors in 2009, who in turn sold the video calling service to Microsoft.\n\nBut Skype's user base has dwindled in recent years, as the app has faced growing competition from video calling and messaging alternatives such as Zoom, WhatsApp and Slack. The app went from roughly 40 million users in early 2020 to 36 million in 2023.\n\nMicrosoft says Skype users can automatically migrate all of their chats and contacts directly to Teams."
