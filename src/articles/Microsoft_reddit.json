If any of you are still struggling give a startup idea a shot. Itâ€™s good experience and hey you never know. If anyone wants to join me dm me. \n\nTo those who are struggling keep trying and do projects. Gather some friends work on something together. Leetcoding all day is exhausting. \n\nBest of luck everyone. \n\nEdit: I should add that you can ace your interview , give perfect answers and they will love you and still be rejected because someone else also did well but they fit the Job description better ðŸ¥²\n\nEdit 2: guys Iâ€™m getting lots of Dms. I promise I will get to you all but to those who think I have a startup idea established I donâ€™t. Iâ€™m just talking with people bouncing ideas and if itâ€™s something we both like we can give it a shot. "
