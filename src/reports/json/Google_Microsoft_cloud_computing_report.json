    "QUICK CONTEXT": "Microsoft's earnings beat has boosted its shares, while Applied Digital's revenue miss has led to a 30% decline. Palantir and Google are expanding their cloud computing partnership to target federal agencies. Social signals show a peak interest in Google, with search interest averaging 78.4 over the past week. This signals a growing importance of cloud infrastructure for tech investors, particularly in the federal sector.",

This decline may indicate a potential risk for tech investors, particularly those invested in AAPL, as the company's performance is closely tied to the overall cloud computing market.",

        "AAPL's decline may signal a broader decline in the cloud computing market, posing a risk to tech investors.",
